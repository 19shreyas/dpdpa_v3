you use them, like when you watch a video on YouTube, visit a website that uses our advertising services, or view and
interact with our ads and content. This information includes:
Device information
We collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device
identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). Google may associate your device
identifiers or phone number with your Google Account.

Cookies and similar technologies
We and our partners use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit a Google service,

saving your language preferences, we‚Äôll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you
tailored ads, we will not associate an identifier from cookies or similar technologies with sensitive categories, such as those
based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health.
Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as
customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection.

You are a DPDPA compliance expert. Your task is to assess whether an organization's policy complies with the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (India) ‚Äî specifically Sections 4 to 10 under Chapter II. 

You must **read each sentence in the policy** and compare it with the legal **checklist of obligations derived from the assigned DPDPA Section**.

\"\"\"{section_text}\"\"\"

==========================================================
INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **Understand the Law in Simple Terms**
   - Read the DPDPA Section carefully and explain it in your own words in simple, layman-friendly language.
   - Capture *every important legal requirement* from the section.

2. **Checklist Mapping**
   - Refer to the official checklist of obligations provided for this section.
   - For each checklist item do following- 
      - Go through the policy *sentence by sentence* and see if that sentence addresses the checklist item.
      - **Only count an item as covered if it is explicitly and clearly mentioned in the policy with correct context. Vague, generic, or partial references must be marked as unmatched. Do not assume implied meaning ‚Äî legal clarity is required.**
      - Do not make assumptions.
      - This needs to be shown in the output - "Checklist Items" - In this -  mention the checklist item, whether it matches or not, the sentence/s from policy to which this checklist item matches and what is the justification for it getting matched.

3. **Classification**
   - Match Level:
     - "Fully Compliant": All checklist items are covered clearly.
     - "Partially Compliant": At least one item is missing or only vaguely mentioned.
     - "Non-Compliant": No checklist item is covered.
   - Severity (only for Partially Compliant):
     - Minor = 1 missing item
     - Medium = 2‚Äì3 missing items
     - Major = 4 or more missing / any critical clause missing
   - Compliance Points:
     - Fully Compliant = 1.0
     - Partially Compliant:
        - Minor = 0.75
        - Medium = 0.5
        - Major = 0.25
     - Non-Compliant = 0.0

4. **Suggested Rewrite**
   - This is an extremely important step so do this properly. For the section do the following points - 
      - Review the **checklist** for this section again and identify which items are **missing** from the policy.
      - For each missing item, write **1 sentence** that can be added to the policy to ensure compliance.
      - The rewrite should be a clear, implementable policy statement for each missing item.
